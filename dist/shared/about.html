                We see a future of education which is (i) personalized, (ii) efficient, and (iii) delivered through futuristic devices. This is going to get achieved when the human arts of story telling and perspective sharing are weaved skillfully with meticulous strategies for data-modelling, visual-design and AI driven decision making. We are chasing this future.
